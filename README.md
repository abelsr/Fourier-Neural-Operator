## Navier-Stokes equations

This repository contains a code for data generation to solve Navier-Stokes equations using spectral method. The Navier-Stokes equations are given by
$$
\begin{align*}
\partial_t w(x,t) + u(x,t) \cdot \nabla w(x,t) &= \nu \Delta w(x,t) + f(x)\\
\nabla \cdot u(x,t) &= 0\\
w(x,0) &= w_0(x)
\end{align*}
$$

also, it is included a Jupyter notebook to train and test the model using the data generated by the previous code.

## Heat equation

This repository contains a jupyter notebook to solve heat equation using spectral method. The heat equation is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \alpha \nabla^2 u &= 0\\
\end{align*}
$$
